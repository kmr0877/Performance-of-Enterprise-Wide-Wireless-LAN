# Performance-of-Enterprise-Wide-Wireless-LAN

## _Background and Motivation_

To provide ubiquitous enterprise - wide wireless connectivity, many corporations are rolling out large - scale wireless LANs to cover an entire campus.Thousands of interconnected WiFi access points (APs) are deployed all over the campus to provide rich on - line experience for the employees and visitors. UNSW is one such institution with close to 4,000 APs deployed in its Sydney campus. The interconnected campus - wide wireless LAN is called UniWide. Everyday,UniWide is used by thousands of students and employees from hundreds of different locations in the campus, both indoor and outdoor.Unfortunately, the true performance of UniWide at every single location of the campus is difficult to predict. The only way to obtain such a network performance map is to carry out a comprehensive measurement campaign. This project involves designing and executing an experimental study to generate a wireless performance map of UniWide.
